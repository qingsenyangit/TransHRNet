### Train and Test

We provide all code related to the network structure, and the training and testing of the model are consistent with CoTr.

Cotr: Efficiently bridging cnn and transformer for 3d medical image segmentation (https://github.com/YtongXie/CoTr).

That is to say, as long as the network structure in the CoTr project is replaced with the code we provide, it will take effect.
